# Unsupervised Learning Project:
Authors: Pedrazzini Ernesto, Manzi Luca

The project folder has this structure:

 
- main.pynb
  - scripts/ # folder contains the outlier detection algorithms
  - notebooks/ # contains the test we made in order to select hyperparameters
  - output/ # contains the dataset with the added column containing outlier probabilities
  - images/ # contains the output plots
  - data/ # contains datasets


We suggest to execute main.pynb first, then delve in the corresponding script.
