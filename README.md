# Unsupervised Learning Project:
Authors: Ernesto Pedrazzini, Luca Manzi 

The project folder has this structure:

``` 
- main.pynb
  - scripts/ # folder contains the outlier detection algorithms
  - notebooks/ # contains the test we made in order to select hyperparameters
  - output/ # contains the result of our analysis: the dataset with the added column containing outlier probabilities
  - images/ # contains the output plots
  - data/ # contains the dataset
```

We suggest to execute `main.pynb` first, then delve in the corresponding script.
`requirements.txt` lists all the package that are needed to run the project.
the `model.onxx` can be visualized at: https://netron.app/
